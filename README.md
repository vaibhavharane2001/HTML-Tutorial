## Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage by defining various elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## HTML Document Structure
An HTML document is structured with a hierarchy of elements. The basic structure includes elements that define the document's head, title, and body content. Understanding this structure is crucial for organizing and presenting content effectively.

## Basic HTML Tags
HTML uses tags to define different parts of a webpage. Some common tags include those for headings, paragraphs, and divisions. These tags help structure content and determine how it is displayed in the browser.

## HTML Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They typically appear within the opening tag and offer details like identifiers, classes, styles, and more. Understanding attributes is key to customizing and controlling the behavior of HTML elements.

## Creating Links and Images
Links and images are essential components of web pages. Links allow users to navigate between different pages, while images enhance the visual appeal. Both are integrated into HTML using specific tags and attributes.

## Lists and Tables
HTML supports the creation of ordered and unordered lists for organizing content in bullet points or numbered formats. Tables are used to display data in rows and columns, providing a structured format for information.

## Forms and Input Elements
Forms are used to collect user input, making them vital for interactive websites. HTML provides various input elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, and buttons, to create functional forms for data submission.

## Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML involves using tags that convey the meaning and structure of content, such as headers, footers, articles, and sections. This practice improves accessibility, SEO, and overall code readability.

## Best Practices
When writing HTML, it's important to follow best practices, such as proper indentation, the use of semantic tags, and the inclusion of descriptive attributes. These practices contribute to cleaner, more maintainable code and a better user experience.
